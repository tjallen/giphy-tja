# Giphy JavaScript assessment

This is a JS assessment that coded for fun(?) as it was one of the better assesments I've seen.

Basics of the spec: implement the following using React, with a 2 hour time limit
- Make a request to the GIPHY API using the input
- Show 10 results from the response
- Implement a modal on gif click
- Implement pagination

I also used Redux, which made progress slower but would be useful should I ever expand or reuse this in future.

I preserved my progress within the time limit on the [2hours branch](https://github.com/tjallen/giphy-tja/tree/2hours) then continued improving the master branch.
