# Giphy JavaScript assessment

Doing a JS assessment for fun... where did I go wrong in life?

Spec: implement the following using React, with a 2 hour time limit
- Make a request to the GIPHY API using the input
- Show 10 results from the response
- Implement a modal on gif click
- Implement pagination

I added Redux as well, to make it more like the scene in Rocky 4 where Stallone is carrying a log through the Siberian tundra. (Please submit a PR for a better metaphor for things taking longer due to boilerplate but ultimately being worth it, thanks)

Also because Redux is love; Redux is life.

Progress within the time limit was preserved on the [2hours branch](https://github.com/tjallen/giphy-tja/tree/2hours). Continued adding more stuff to master in the meantime. Yatta!
